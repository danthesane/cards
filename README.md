## Cards by Dan James
## Spaced-repetition command-line flashcard software to help with memorization.

Cards was conceived of a need for a simple flashcard utility available for free to all. It allows creation of flash cards,
each composed of a question, an answer, and an optional topic (to help keep them sorted when editing/changing them).

The user can create cards that contain a question that they wish to memorize the answer to, as well as an answer they
will be shown to evaluate the quality of the memorization. Due to the potential complexity of the user's answers,
evaluation is open-ended and left for the user to judge; as in, a user may recall the correct answer, but in a different
wording / configuration than stored on the card. As such, the user's intellectual integrity in the judgement of their
recall is paramount to the success of their learning with this system.
